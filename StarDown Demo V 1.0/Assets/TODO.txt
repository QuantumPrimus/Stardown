-----------BUGS-----------
✔Bug 1: Main Menu buttons click zone seems to be offset from the button itself.  Might attempt to fix this with making a custom
	   type of button with pannels and text objects
Bug 2: When a scene is "Loading in" and the player has their cursor in the buttons area. The buttons text color will change the the hover color and not change back. 


-----------GAME IMPLEMENTATIONS-----------
✔Implement  1 : Add options menu funcionality.Options include volume for sound effects, "Music?", controls and save inbetween scenes.  It should also save 
			   volume settings, controls, etc when closing game and starting again.(Eh?)
